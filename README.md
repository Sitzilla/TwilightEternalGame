# TwilightEternalGame
A single player RPG that uses the LibGDX framework.

*Note: currently a WIP project

## Plot
This land has been ravaged by a war between the forces of good and evil, the neverending combat between the armies of light and the servants of darkness has thrown the world into an Eternal Twilight. Young hero... your destiny awaits!

## Summary
My first attempt at creating a more complex game, this was first started as a hack-week project.  It uses the LibGDX framework, and introduced me to the concept of game development. It introduced me to several gaming concepts such as collision detection, sprite animation, and maintaining state across a large application.
